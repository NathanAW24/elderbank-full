    gcloud topic gcloudignore - reference for [1m.gcloudignore[m files

[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    Several commands in [1mgcloud[m involve uploading the contents of a directory to
    Google Cloud to host or build. In many cases, you will not want to upload
    certain files (i.e., "ignore" them).

    If there is a file called [1m.gcloudignore[m [4min the top-level directory to
    upload[m, the files that it specifies (see "SYNTAX") will be ignored.

    Gcloud commands may generate a .gcloudignore file; see the individual
    command help page for details.

    The following [1mgcloud[m commands respect the [1m.gcloudignore[m file:

      o [1mgcloud app deploy[m
        * Note: If you add [1mapp.yaml[m to the [1m.gcloudignore[m file, this command
          will fail.
      o [1mgcloud functions deploy[m
      o [1mgcloud builds submit[m
      o [1mgcloud composer environments storage {dags, data, plugins} import[m
      o [1mgcloud container builds submit[m
      o [1mgcloud run deploy[m
      o [1mgcloud run jobs deploy[m
      o gcloud alpha deploy releases create
      o [1mgcloud alpha blueprints apply[m
      o [1mgcloud alpha blueprints preview[m
      o [1mgcloud alpha run jobs deploy[m
      o [1mgcloud beta run jobs deploy[m

    To globally disable [1m.gcloudignore[m parsing (including default file-ignore
    behavior), run:

        $ gcloud config set gcloudignore/enabled false

    The default content of the generated [1m.gcloudignore[m file, which can be
    overriden with [1m--ignore-file[m, is as follows:

        .gcloudignore
        .git
        .gitignore

[m[1mEXAMPLES[m
    This [1m.gcloudignore[m would prevent the upload of the [1mnode_modules/[m directory
    and any files ending in [1m~[m:

        /node_modules/
        *~

    This [1m.gcloudignore[m (similar to the one generated when Git files are
    present) would prevent the upload of the [1m.gcloudignore[m file, the [1m.git[m
    directory, and any files in ignored in the [1m.gitignore[m file:

        .gcloudignore
        # If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or
        # files from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line below:
        .git
        .gitignore
        #!include:.gitignore

[m[1mSYNTAX[m
    The syntax of [1m.gcloudignore[m borrows heavily from that of [1m.gitignore[m; see
    https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore or [1mman gitignore[m for a full reference.

    Each line in a [1m.gcloudignore[m is one of the following:

      o [1mpattern[m: a pattern specifies file names to ignore (or explicitly
        include) in the upload. If multiple patterns match the file name, the
        last matching pattern takes precedence.
      o [1mcomment[m: comments begin with [1m#[m and are ignored (see "ADVANCED TOPICS"
        for an exception). If you want to include a [1m#[m at the beginning of a
        pattern, you must escape it: [1m\#[m.
      o [1mblank line[m: A blank line is ignored and useful for readability.

    Some example patterns follow; see the full reference
    (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore or [1mman gitignore[m) for details.

    To ignore any file named [1mfoo[m, and any file in the root of the upload
    directory named [1mbar[m:

        foo
        /bar

    To ignore any file starting with [1mfoo[m, ending with [1mbar[m, or starting with [1mbaz[m
    and ending with [1mqux[m:

        foo*
        *bar
        baz*qux

    To explicitly include any file named [1mfoo[m (useful if [1mfoo[m was excluded
    earlier in the file) and ignore a file named [1m!bar[m:

        !foo
        \!bar

    To ignore any directory [1mfoo[m and all its contents (though not a file [1mfoo[m),
    any file [1mbaz[m, and the directory [1mqux[m and all its contents:

        foo/
        **/baz
        qux/**

[m  [1mADVANCED TOPICS[m
    In order to ignore files specified in the gitignore file, there is a
    special comment syntax:

        #!include:.gitignore

    This will insert the content of a [1m.gitignore[m-style file named [1m.gitignore[m at
    the point of the include line. It does not recurse (that is, the included
    file [1mcannot[m [1m#!include[m another file) and cannot be anywhere but the
    top-level directory to be uploaded.

    To display files that will be uploaded run:

        gcloud meta list-files-for-upload
